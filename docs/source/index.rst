Agglomerative Clustering for ORganising Nested Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``acorns`` is a package designed for the hierarchical clustering of astronomical
data. It was specifically designed to work with decomposed
spectroscopic data (i.e. the kinematic information extracted following spectral
line fitting). However, it can be used with images as well.

The source code is provided `here <https://github.com/jdhenshaw/acorns>`_, and
comments and contributions are very welcome.
